# ChatGPT Trip Scheduler

Welcome to the ChatGPT Trip Scheduler project! This readme provides instructions for setting up and running the Streamlit application located in the `src` directory.

## Installation

Before running the Streamlit application, you need to install the required dependencies listed in the `requirements.txt` file. To do this, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:** If you haven't already, clone this Git repository to your local machine using the following command:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mebi-ali/Trip-Scheduler
Navigate to the Project Directory: Change your working directory to the project's root folder:

  ```bash
  cd Trip-Scheduler
2. **Create a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended):** It is recommended to create a virtual environment to isolate the project's dependencies. You can create a virtual environment using venv or conda. Here's an example using venv:

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv

3. **Activate the Virtual Environment:** Activate the virtual environment:

   ```bash
   source venv/bin/activate
Install Dependencies: Use pip to install the required dependencies from requirements.txt:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
Running the Streamlit Application
Once you've installed the required dependencies, you can run the ChatGPT Trip Scheduler Streamlit application using the following command:

   ```bash
   streamlit run src/app.py
This command will start the Streamlit development server and open the application in your default web browser.
